## DIY PCB - Create a FCBInfinity PCB yourself ##
Ah, you decided to go hardcore and create the board yourself. Not a wise choice, because I found that it was a LOT of work drilling all those holes and connecting the vias. However, should you still want to create the board yourself (because after all, that's the cheapest) you can use the toner transfer pdf's above to do a toner transfer and etch the board yourself.
