Behringer FCB1010 modification: FCBInfinity!
===========

This is the home of all the source and schematics for my FCBInfinity project. In this DIY-project I will completely redo the internals of the Behringer FCB1010 midi foot controller. I will add an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) and some extra buttons and leds to the controller. Hopefully the net result will be an awesome foot pedal that allows me to see realtime data (such as Tuner and Patchnames of my Fractal Audio AxeFx-II).
